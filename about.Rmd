My name is Lucie Marin. I am 21 years old and I am in third year of biological sciences (BAB3). I am at the University of Mons in Belgium. I really like science and biological phenomena. As in any scientific study, I have to learn English because it is the language of science.
This blog will bring together several scientific articles on biomimicry.
This work will allow me to improve my English considerably.
I am in the 3rd group in English is Madame Bouchet my teacher who evaluates me for this project.
