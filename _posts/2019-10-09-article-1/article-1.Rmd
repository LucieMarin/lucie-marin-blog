| Published in?                | July 10, 2019                                                       |
| General topic?               |  This article discusses the many solutions to the problems that mussel can bring. Many studies are done on this organism. Produce super resistant adhesives, purify water, fight the oil spills ... all this will be possible with the mussels !                     |
| Procedure/what was examined? | There are several research inspired by the mussel.     The property of this bivalve is the manufacture of super resistant byssus string from dihydroxyphenylalanine. This molecule allows adhesion to all substrates through these bonds and interactions. Dopamine has similar properties. Researchers have looked at dopamine and want to use it as a coating for many materials. In more , adhesion substances in water are highly coveted.       The mussels have already been used to develop a universal red blood cell. The red blood cell is coated which prevents an immune response of the body.           Other researchers have developed materials that can separate hydrocarbons from water. Oils spills are made from hydrocarbon. It is therefore a solution to protect the environment of these phenomena.         The mussel is an organism that filters water, this property is also analyzed by scientists. This new technology allows to filter heavy metals, organic pollutants, pathogens, ... The technique is also developed from dopamine.            The mussel offers solutions.Researchers are inspired by nature for new technologies. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       |  The researchers drew on the unique capabilities of the mussel to create new technologies in different fields. Medicine with red blood cells, the environment with the purification of water and the elimination of oil spills, in the industry with new adhesive properties,...      |
| Remaining questions?         | Scientists still have to work to improve these technologies. First, dopamine should be placed in alkaline conditions. Therefore alkaline sensitive substances cannot be used.     More, efficiency and cost must be further improved. |
