| General topic?               | This article shows what biomimetic can bring to medicine so far. The articles tell us about examples of architecture, engineering ... But not yet in a purely medical environment. Three discoveries have been described. The first is jellyfish collagen which is said to be much more reliable than that of other animals. Collagen is the most widely used protein in mammals and is often used in medicine. The problem is that current collagen sometimes has pathogenic effects. With jellyfish collagen, it would be much safer. The second example is a material that can replace some damaged body structures such as bones. This material comes from a plant and offers regenerating and creative properties. The last example is the glue produced by worms which could replace the glue in medicine because it is more resistant.                    |
| Procedure/what was examined? | For the first example, jellyfish collagen. It is an ancestral collagen and the basis of all other collagens. It is therefore compatible with many cells. There are also fewer immune responses in the body. For the second example, the scientists were inspired by a plant capable of reproducing the bone structure and serving as a scaffold for bone regeneration. This would allow the patient to heal faster for less money.For the third example, the researchers made a glue by copying a worm. This glue is very resistant. It is designed to be very viscous and hydrophobic, it has much less difficulty in staying in place. The glue is stabilised by UV rays and resists the pressure of blood vessels. This adhesive has been tested on several patients and the results are convincing. |
| Conclusions/discovery?       | Biomimicry allows medicine to evolve faster. The 3 products developed bring great progress. These products come from nature, so there is no immune problem. By imitating nature, we do not start from nothing, nature helps us to go faster. The 3 products will soon be on sale and this shows us that humanity needs nature to evolve.      |
| Remaining questions?         | What other elements of nature contribute most to the evolution of medicine? |
