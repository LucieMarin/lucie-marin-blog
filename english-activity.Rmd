English is a language used by all. It is therefore very important to master it.

I try to use English more and more, in order to improve myself.
The first use is for series. I'm a fan of 2 or 3 series and I can not wait for the French version. English was the language internationnal it is in this language that the episode was released first.
Then I use English to expand my knowledge. When I look for information, they are always more complete in English. If I want an answer it's in English that I would have the most complete and relevant.
English also serves me in the communication of idea, if I want to give or receive advice with someone who does not speak French, I would have more chance to have an answer and to be understood by speaking English which is the international language.
I play video games from time to time and English is very useful to me.
My level of English is not perfect and I know I have trouble speaking. That's why I attend at classes on Saturdays that will improve my oral in English. I hope these courses will help me to express myself better.
